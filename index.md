## About
Moldavian born living in Amsterdam. Currently graduating in Documentary Photography at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. As a visual artist with a background in international economics and social work, I tend to confront myself with futuristic and political topics. My artistic practice revolves around the technology topic and the question of how does it influence our life. It includes personal visualizations of alternative possibilities and speculative ideas of new technologies within our future by using photography and moving images.

After my recent experience as a researcher at the Prince Claus Fund in Amsterdam, I’m now looking for ways to have an active role in promoting arts and culture in less privileged regions of the world. Through practical research, I am involved in curating and managing events that support contemporary photography. My personal goal is to use my knowledge and experience and establish an Art Organisation that helps grow the photography community in less developed regions and societies, such as Republic of Moldova, the country I immigrated from.
