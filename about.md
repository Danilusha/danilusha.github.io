# Profile
Currently attending the  documentary photography course at Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. As a visual artist with a background in advertising, international economics and social work, I tend to confront myself with futuristic and political topics. My personal drive focuses on the visualisation of alternative possibilities for mankind, the impact of new technologies and approaches towards life, Iâ€™m aiming to highlight their societal influence in my work.
