# Hi I'm Daniela
Currently attending the  documentary photography course at Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague. As a visual artist with a background in advertising, international economics and social work, I tend to confront myself with futuristic and political topics. My personal drive helps me focus on the visualisation of alternative possibilities for mankind - the impact of new technologies and approaches towards life, I’m aiming to highlight their societal influence in my work.
