## Hi there!
I am Moldavian born, living in Amsterdam, visual artist with a background in international economics and social work. In my artistic practice, I tend to confront myself with topics related to my home country. As a professional I’m genuinely enjoying working in the educational field or administrative office of a cultural organization. This helps me to align with my core value of supporting and contributing to the arts & culture in the society.
